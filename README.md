# Realtime Beresheet Sim
Beresheet spacecraft realtime simulator

By Itamar Caspi and Joseph Mamo

This project simulates ![Beresheet landing (sim)](https://github.com/itamarcasspi/Beresheet_sim) in real time.
The user has the option to change the properties of the spacecraft such as vertical speed, horizontal speed, fuel, PID controller parameters (for the spaceship VS) and more. 

For a deeper understanding of the simulation please read the landing ![simulation report](https://github.com/itamarcasspi/Beresheet_sim/blob/main/Simulation_report.md).
This report uses the actual parameters of the real Bereshit spacecraft landing (such as altitude, vs and more).

## The simulation menu

The user can try the actual Bereshit spacecraft simulation by using the default values for the simulation, or experiment by himself and use different values.

## The simulation panel

The user can try and set his own landing plan by entering his custom desired vertical speed (DVS) and desired horizontal speed (DHS) in the spaceship control panel (top middle).

On the bottom left the simulation control panel allows the user to exit to menu, pause the simulation, and control the simulation time scaling (far left is realistic time caling and far right accelerates time by 50:1.
